"<pad> the encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. each layer has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a feed-forward network. the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. to facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension d_(</s>"
