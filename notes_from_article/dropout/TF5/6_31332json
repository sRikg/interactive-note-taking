"<pad> dropout was applied to all the layers of the network with the probability of retaining ahidden unit being p = (0.9, 0.75, 0.75, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5) for the different layers of the network. the best performing convolutional nets that do not use dropout achieve an errorrate of 3.95%. Adding dropout only to the fully connected layers reduces the error to 3.02%. Adding dropout to the convolutional layers as well further reduce<extra_id_27>.<extra_id_27>.<extra_id_27>.</s>"
