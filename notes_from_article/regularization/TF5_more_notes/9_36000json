"<pad> ablations for our best LSTM models reporting results over the validation and test set on Penn Treebank and WikiText-2. were split into optimization and regularization variants, sorted according to the achieved validation perplexity on WikiText-2. the most extreme perplexity jump was in removing the hidden-to-hidden LSTM regularization provided by the weight-dropped LSTM. without such hidden-to-hidden regularization, perplexity rises substantially, up to 11 points... a</s>"
