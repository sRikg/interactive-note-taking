"<pad> the main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word vectors from huge data sets. none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more than a few hundred of millions of words. we use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representations, with the expectation that similar words tend to be close to each other. we design a new comprehensive test set for measuring both syntactic and semantic regularities.</s>"
