"<pad> the main goal of this paper is to introduce techniques that can be used for learning high-quality word vectors from huge data sets. none of the previously proposed architectures has been successfully trained on more than a few hundred of millions of words, with a modest dimensionality of the word vectors between 50 - 100. we use recently proposed techniques for measuring the quality of the resulting vector representa- tions, with the aim of improving the quality of the resulting vector representations. the resulting vector representa- - - a</s>"
