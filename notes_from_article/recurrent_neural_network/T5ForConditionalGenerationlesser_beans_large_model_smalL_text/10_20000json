"<pad> if we want to build models that can really learn language, then on-line learning is crucial. it does not seem that simple recurrent neural networks can capture truly long context infor- mation, as cache models still provide complementary informa- tion even to dynamic models trained with BPTT. as we did not make any task or language specific assump- tion in our work, it is easy to use RNN based models almost ef- fortlessly in any kind of application that uses back- a- a</s>"
