"<pad> a large deep LSTM, that has a limited vocabulary, can outperform a standard SMT-based system on a large-scale MT task. the success of our simple LSTM-based approach on MT suggests that it should do well on many other sequence learning problems, provided they have enough training data. we were also surprised by the ability of the LSTM to correctly translate very long sentences, even when the source sentences were reversed. our results suggest that further work will likely lead to even a a a</s>"
