"<pad> if we measure progress in language modeling by ability to better predict sequen- tial data, considerable improvement has been achieved. language models for real-world speech recognition or machine translation systems are built on huge amounts of data. most of the proposed advanced language modeling techniques provide only tiny improvements over simple baselines, and are rarely used in practice. recurrent neural networks for modeling sequential data are based on feedforward neural networks with fixed- length context. recurrent neural networks perform better than mixture of several other models based a a a</s>"
