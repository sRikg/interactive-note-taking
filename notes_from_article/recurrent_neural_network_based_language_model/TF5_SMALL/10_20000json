"<pad> on-line learning provides natural way how to obtain cache-like and trigger-like information. further investigation into backpropagation through time algorithm for learning recurrent neural networks will provide additional improvements. but it does not seem that simple recurrent neural networks can capture truly long context infor- mation. it is easy to use RNN based models almost ef- fortlessly in any kind of application that uses backoff language models, like machine translation or OCR. we hope that these connections will be \u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad</s>"
