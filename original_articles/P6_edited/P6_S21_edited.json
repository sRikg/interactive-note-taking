"A task studied in developmental linguistics [10] is the ability to learn and utilize new words, for example using a word in a sentence after seeing it defined only once, or conversely inferring a word\u2019s meaning from only one usage. Here we qualitatively test GPT-3\u2019s ability to do the former. Specifically, we give GPT-3 the definition of a nonexistent word, such as \u201cGigamuru\u201d, and then ask it to use it in a sentence. We provide one to five previous examples of a (separate) nonexistent word being defined and used in a sentence, so the task is few-shot in terms of previous examples of the broad task and one-shot in terms of the specific word. Table 3.16 shows the 6 examples we generated; all definitions were human-generated, and the first answer was human-generated as conditioning while the subsequent answers were generated by GPT-3. These examples were generated continuously in one sitting and we did not omit or repeatedly try any prompts. In all cases the generated sentence appears to be a correct or at least plausible use of the word. In the final sentence the model generates a plausible conjugation for the word \u201cscreeg\u201d (namely \u201cscreeghed\u201d), although the use of the word is slightly awkward (\u201cscreeghed at each other\u201d) despite being plausible in the sense that it could describe a toy sword fight. Overall, GPT-3 appears to be at least proficient at the task of using novel words in a sentence."
