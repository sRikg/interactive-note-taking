In this work, we showed that a large deep LSTM with a limited vocabulary can outperform a standard SMT-based system whose vocabulary is unlimited on a large-scale MT task. The success of our simple LSTM-based approach on MT suggests that it should do well on many other sequence learning problems, provided they have enough training data. We were surprised by the extent of the improvement obtained by reversing the words in the source sentences. We conclude that it is important to find a problem encoding that has the greatest number of short term dependencies, as they make the learning problem much simpler. In particular, while we were unable to train a standard RNN on the non-reversed translation problem (shown in fig. 1), we believe that a standard RNN should be easily trainable when the source sentences are reversed (although we did not verify it experimentally). We were also surprised by the ability of the LSTM to correctly translate very long sentences. We were initially convinced that the LSTM would fail on long sentences due to its limited memory, and other researchers reported poor performance on long sentences with a model similar to ours [5, 2, 26]. And yet, LSTMs trained on the reversed dataset had little difficulty translating long sentences. Most importantly, we demonstrated that a simple, straightforward and a relatively unoptimized approach can outperform a mature SMT system, so further work will likely lead to even greater translation accuracies. These results suggest that our approach will likely do well on other challenging sequence to sequence problems.
