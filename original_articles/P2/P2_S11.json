Figure 2:The figure shows a 2-dimensional PCA projection of the LSTM hidden states that are obtained after processing the phrases in the figures. The phrases are clustered by meaning, which in these examples is primarily a function of word order, which would be difficult to capture with a bag-of-words model. Notice that both clusters have similar internal structure. Figure 3:The left plot shows the performance of our system as a function of sentence length, where the x-axis corresponds to the test sentences sorted by their length and is marked by the actual sequence lengths. There is no degradation on sentences with less than 35 words, there is only a minor degradation on the longest sentences. The right plot shows the LSTM’s performance on sentences with progressively more rare words, where the x-axis corresponds to the test sentences sorted by their “average word frequency rank”. One of the attractive features of our model is its ability to turn a sequence of words into a vector of fixed dimensionality. Figure 2 visualizes some of the learned representations. The figure clearly shows that the representations are sensitive to the order of words, while being fairly insensitive to the replacement of an active voice with a passive voice. The two-dimensional projections are obtained using PCA.
