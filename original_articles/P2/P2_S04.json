We applied our method to the WMT’14 English to French MT task in two ways. We used it to directly translate the input sentence without using a reference SMT system and we it to rescore the n-best lists of an SMT baseline. We report the accuracy of these translation methods, present sample translations, and visualize the resulting sentence representation. 3.1 Dataset details We used the WMT’14 English to French dataset. We trained our models on a subset of 12M sentences consisting of 348M French words and 304M English words, which is a clean “selected” subset from [29]. We chose this translation task and this specific training set subset because of the public availability of a tokenized training and test set together with 1000-best lists from the baseline SMT [29]. As typical neural language models rely on a vector representation for each word, we used a fixed vocabulary for both languages. We used 160,000 of the most frequent words for the source language and 80,000 of the most frequent words for the target language. Every out-of-vocabulary word was replaced with a special “UNK” token.
