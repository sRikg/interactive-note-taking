Another task well suited for few-shot learning is correcting English grammar. We test this with GPT-3 in the few-shot setting by giving prompts of the form \"Poor English Input: <sentence>\\n Good English Output: <sentence>\". We give GPT-3 one human-generated correction and then ask it to correct 5 more (again without any omissions or repeats). Results are shown in Figure 3.17.
