First, single-layer": null, "representations were learned using word vectors [74, 92] and fed to": null, "task-specific architectures, then RNNs with multiple layers of": null, "representations and contextual state were used to form stronger": null, "representations [19, 73, 90] (though still applied to task-specific": null, "architectures), and more recently pre-trained recurrent or transformer": null, "language models [123] have been directly fine-tuned, entirely removing": null, "the need for task-specific architectures [101, 16, 36].": null, "[Figure 1.1: Language model meta-learning. During unsupervised": null, "pre-training, a language model develops a broad set of skills and": null, "pattern recognition abilities. It then uses these abilities at inference": null, "time to rapidly adapt to or recognize the desired task. We use the term": null, "\u201cin-context learning\u201d to describe the inner loop of this process, which": null, "occurs within the forward-pass upon each sequence. The sequences in this": null, "diagram are not intended to be representative of the data a model would": null, "see during pre-training, but are intended to show that there are": null, "sometimes repeated sub-tasks embedded within a single sequence.]": null, "This last paradigm has led to substantial progress on many challenging": null, "NLP tasks such as reading comprehension, question answering, textual": null, "entailment, and many others, and has continued to advance based on new": null, "architectures and algorithms [105, 67, 128, 54]. However, a major": null, "limitation to this approach is that while the architecture is": null, "task-agnostic, there is still a need for task-specific datasets and": null, "task-specific fine-tuning: to achieve strong performance on a desired": null, "task typically requires fine-tuning on a dataset of thousands to": null, "hundreds of thousands of examples specific to that task. Removing this": null, "limitation would be desirable, for several reasons.": null, "First, from a practical perspective, the need for a large dataset of": null, "labeled examples for every new task limits the applicability of language": null, "models. There exists a very wide range of possible useful language": null, "tasks, encompassing anything from correcting grammar, to generating": null, "examples of an abstract concept, to critiquing a short story. For many": null, "of these tasks it is difficult to collect a large supervised training": null, "dataset, especially when the process must be repeated for every new": null, "task.": null, "Second, the potential to exploit spurious correlations in training data": null, "fundamentally grows with the expressiveness of the model and the": null, "narrowness of the training distribution. This can create problems for": null, "the pre-training plus fine-tuning paradigm, where models are designed to": null, "be large to absorb information during pre-training, but are then": null, "fine-tuned on very narrow task distributions. For instance [34] observe": null, "that larger models do not necessarily generalize better": null, "out-of-distribution. There is evidence that suggests that the": null, "generalization achieved under this paradigm can be poor because the": null, "model is overly specific to the training distribution and does not": null, "generalize well outside it [127, 80]. Thus, the performance of": null, "fine-tuned models on specific benchmarks, even when it is nominally at": null, "human-level, may exaggerate actual performance on the underlying task": null, "[29, 83].": null, "Third, humans do not require large supervised datasets to learn most": null, "language tasks \u2013 a brief directive in natural language (e.g. \u201cplease": null, "tell me if this sentence describes something happy or something sad\u201d) or": null, "at most a tiny number of demonstrations (e.g. \u201chere are two examples of": null, "people acting brave; please give a third example of bravery\u201d) is often": null, "sufficient to enable a human to perform a new task to at least a": null, "reasonable degree of competence.

To be broadly useful, we would someday like": null, "our NLP systems to have this same fluidity and generality.": null, "One potential route towards addressing these issues is": null, "meta-learning\u00b9\u00b91In the context of language models this has sometimes": null, "been called \u201czero-shot transfer\u201d, but this term is potentially": null, "ambiguous: the method is \u201czero-shot\u201d in the sense that no gradient": null, "updates are performed, but it often involves providing inference-time": null, "demonstrations to the model, so is not truly learning from zero": null, "examples.

Therefore, we start": null, "this section by explicitly defining and contrasting the different": null, "settings that we will be evaluating GPT-3 on or could in principle": null, "evaluate GPT-3 on. These settings can be seen as lying on a spectrum of": null, "how much task-specific data they tend to rely on.

However, defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan, who had a highly acrimonious relationship with Ditka, called Perry a \"wasted draft-pick\". Perry soon became a pawn in the political power struggle between Ditka and Ryan. Perry\u2019s \"Refrigerator\" nickname followed him into the NFL and he quickly became a favorite of the Chicago Bears fans. Teammates called him \"Biscuit,\" as in \"one biscuit shy of 350 pounds.\" While Ryan refused to play Perry, Ditka decided to use Perry as a fullback when the team was near the opponents\u2019 goal line or in fourth and short situations, either as a ball carrier or a lead blocker for star running back Walter Payton. Ditka stated the inspiration for using Perry as a fullback came to him during five-yard sprint exercises. During his rookie season, Perry rushed for two touchdowns and caught a pass for one. Perry even had the opportunity to run the ball during Super Bowl XX, as a nod to his popularity and contributions to the team\u2019s success. The first time he got the ball, he was tackled for a one-yard loss while attempting to throw his first NFL pass on a halfback option play. The second time he got the ball, he scored a touchdown (running over Patriots linebacker Larry McGrew in the process). About halfway through his rookie season, Ryan finally began to play Perry, who soon proved that he was a capable defensive lineman. His Super Bowl ring size is the largest of any professional football player in the history of the event. His ring size is 25, while the ring size for the average adult male is between 10 and 12. Perry went on to play for ten years in the NFL, retiring after the 1994 season. In his ten years as a pro, he regularly struggled with his weight, which hampered his performance at times. He played in 138 games, recording 29.5 sacks and five fumble recoveries, which he returned for a total of 71 yards. In his offensive career he ran five yards for two touchdowns, and had one reception for another touchdown. Perry later attempted a comeback, playing an unremarkable 1996 season with the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football (later NFL Europa).": null, "                        Q: what team did he play for?": null, "  Target Completion \u2192   the Chicago Bears": null, "Figure G.25: Formatted dataset example for QuAC": null, "                        r e!c.i p r o.c a/l =": null, "  Target Completion \u2192   reciprocal": null, "Figure G.26: Formatted dataset example for Symbol Insertion": null, "                        taefed =": null, "  Target Completion \u2192   defeat": null, "Figure G.27: Formatted dataset example for Reversed Words": null, "  --------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------": null, "  Context \u2192             Title: The_Blitz": null, "                        Background: From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement.

Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger\u00e4t beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute.

The normal force here represents the force applied by the table against the object that prevents it from sinking through the table and requires that the table is sturdy enough to deliver this normal force without breaking. However, it is easy to assume that the normal force and weight are action-reaction force pairs (a common mistake).
