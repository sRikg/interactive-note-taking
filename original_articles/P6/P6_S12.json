"Setting PIQA ARC (Easy) ARC (Challenge) OpenBookQA - Fine-tuned SOTA 79.4 92.0[47] 78.5[47] 87.2[47] GPT-3 Zero-Shot 80.5* 68.8 51.4 57.6 GPT-3 One-Shot 80.5* 71.2 53.2 58.8 GPT-3 Few-Shot 82.8* 70.1 51.5 65.4 Table 3.6: GPT-3 results on three commonsense reasoning tasks, PIQA, ARC, and OpenBookQA. GPT-3 Few-Shot PIQA result is evaluated on the test server. See Section 4.1 for details on potential contamination issues on the PIQA test set. [Figure 3.6: GPT-3 results on PIQA in the zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot settings. The largest model achieves a score on the development set in all three conditions that exceeds the best recorded score on the task.] Next we consider three datasets which attempt to capture physical or scientific reasoning, as distinct from sentence completion, reading comprehension, or broad knowledge question answering. The first, PhysicalQA (PIQA) [8], asks common sense questions about how the physical world works and is intended as a probe of grounded understanding of the world. GPT-3 achieves 81.0% accuracy zero-shot, 80.5% accuracy one-shot, and 82.8% accuracy few-shot (the last measured on PIQA\u2019s test server). This compares favorably to the 79.4% accuracy prior state-of-the-art of a fine-tuned RoBERTa. PIQA shows relatively shallow scaling with model size and is still over 10% worse than human performance, but GPT-3\u2019s few-shot and even zero-shot result outperform the current state-of-the-art. Our analysis flagged PIQA for a potential data contamination issue (despite hidden test labels), and we therefore conservatively mark the result with an asterisk. See Section 4.1 for details. ARC [11] is a dataset of multiple-choice questions collected from 3rd to 9th grade science exams. On the \u201cChallenge\u201d version of the dataset which has been filtered to questions which simple statistical or information retrieval methods are unable to correctly answer, GPT-3 achieves 51.4% accuracy in the zero-shot setting, 53.2% in the one-shot setting, and 51.5% in the few-shot setting. This is approaching the performance of a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline (55.9%) from UnifiedQA [47]. On the \u201cEasy\u201d version of the dataset (questions which either of the mentioned baseline approaches answered correctly), GPT-3 achieves 68.8%, 71.2%, and 70.1% which slightly exceeds a fine-tuned RoBERTa baseline from [47]. However, both of these results are still much worse than the overall SOTAs achieved by the UnifiedQA which exceeds GPT-3\u2019s few-shot results by 27% on the challenge set and 22% on the easy set. On OpenBookQA [76], GPT-3 improves significantly from zero to few shot settings but is still over 20 points short of the overall SOTA. GPT-3\u2019s few-shot performance is similar to a fine-tuned BERT Large baseline on the leaderboard. Overall, in-context learning with GPT-3 shows mixed results on commonsense reasoning tasks, with only small and inconsistent gains observed in the one and few-shot learning settings for both PIQA and ARC, but a significant improvement is observed on OpenBookQA. GPT-3 sets SOTA on the new PIQA dataset in all evaluation settings."
